# UFO Sightings

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to build a webpage that contains a dynamic table based on the data of UFO sightings, so that users are able to filter the data by different criteria and see the results. This feature is realized through JavaScript. 

## Results

Below shows the initial webpage.

To apply the filter, all that need to be done is to enter the information in the boxes on the left. The filter can be applied towards the following five criteria. 

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

Below shows the filtered after the filter as an example.

## Summary

### Drawback

There are quite a lot of different types of shape. If the user do not know a shape existing, the search will be quite limited. 

### Recommendations for further development

Instead of text boxes, certain criteria such as Country, Ctate, and Shape can be summarized and filtered by a dropdown menu, so that users are able to know what the existing data looks like. 

Instead of specifying one date, a date range could be applied to this webpage, for the users to filter out the data within a specific date range.
